Rewards:
    the reward is how much the total delay
    (sum of the waiting times of all approaching vehicles) changed in relation to the previous time-step.

Action:
    The action space is discrete. Every 'delta_time' seconds,
    each traffic signal agent can choose the next green phase configuration.

Observation:
    obs = [phase_one_hot, min_green, lane_1_density,...,lane_n_density, lane_1_queue,...,lane_n_queue]
    phase_one_hot is a one-hot encoded vector indicating the current active green phase
    min_green is a binary variable indicating whether min_green seconds have already passed in the current phase
    lane_i_density is the number of vehicles in incoming lane i dividided by the total capacity of the lane
    lane_i_queueis the number of queued (speed below 0.1 m/s) vehicles in incoming lane i divided by the total capacity of the lane
